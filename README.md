# KarisAI  
Offline quiz platform for low-end Android devices in poor-connectivity areas.

## Inspiration  
In Kaduna North, a lot of students and learners are held back because of poor internet access.  
I've seen talented youths struggle to find educational platforms that don’t demand heavy data or high-end smartphones.  
This challenge inspired KarisAI – a lightweight, offline quiz platform built specifically for resource-constrained environments.

## What it does  
KarisAI allows students to take quizzes offline without internet. They can download quiz packs when they have access and use them later.

## How we built it  
- Designed using XML and Java for Android (targeting low-end phones)
- Used Google Maps API for optional location-based features (like school centers)
- Lightweight SQLite database for local quiz storage
- Focused on simplicity, speed, and offline support

## Challenges we ran into  
- Making the app work without internet at all
- Keeping the app small and compatible with old Android phones
- Building an intuitive UI without advanced animations or libraries

## Accomplishments that we're proud of  
- Offline quiz system that works perfectly on budget Android phones
- Clean, lightweight UI design
- Map integration that doesn’t break even with slow networks

## What we learned  
- How to optimize for low-resource environments
- Handling data persistence with SQLite
- Testing across multiple Android versions for compatibility

## What's next for KarisAI  
- Add Hausa language support for wider adoption in Northern Nigeria
- Include offline learning videos and materials
- Partner with schools to distribute quiz packs monthly

## Built With  
- Android Studio  
- Java  
- XML  
- SQLite  
- Google Maps API
