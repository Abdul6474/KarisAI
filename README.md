**Offline Quiz Platform for Low-End Android Devices in Poor Connectivity Areas**

## 📌 Inspiration

In Kaduna North, many learners are left behind due to poor internet access and limited access to educational tools. I’ve met many talented youths who want to study but can’t afford data-heavy platforms or high-end smartphones. That’s what inspired KarisAI — a lightweight offline quiz platform made for resource-limited environments.
